# HOSS (Haskell Open Source)
A list of Open Source Haskell projects appreciate contributions.

- Maybe you'd like to be a professional Haskell developer and work on some Haskell code. Maybe you'd just like the experience
  of working on Open Source projects in Haskell!
- I'm hoping to start this little repo and add to it over time. Hopefully people who like Haskell
  can also add any open source projects so that people can find them and contribute.
- In the future, I'd also like to add an anonymous rating system for the friendliness of the project
  to newbies, and estimated time to hear back from the maintainer of the repo.

## Smaller Projects
- By name and link This may be of help for persons intimidated by the size of code involved in open source, or
  the number of persons involved in larger projects / repos. (alphabetize)
  
- [CodeWorld](https://github.com/google/codeworld)


## Larger Projects
- More people, faster help, larger code-base.
- 

## Pull requests
- Please feel free to add a pull request if you'd like to add to the repo. Thank you! :D
