# HOSS (Haskell Open Source)
A list of Open Source Haskell projects appreciate contributions.

- I'm hoping to start this little repo and add to it over time. Hopefully people who like Haskell
  can also add any open source projects so that people can find them and contribute.
- In the future, I'd also like to add an anonymous rating system for the friendliness of the project
  to newbies, and estimated time to hear back from the maintainer of the repo.
